title: The two features of Reaper 7 I like the most
---

Having started using Reaper around 2008, I can safely consider myself not a beginner user.
With some back and forth, having done detours to Cakewalk Sonar, Cubase, Ableton Live, I have finally decided to stick
to this wonderfully powerful, ableit not exactly the begineer-friendliest and slicky looking, DAW. I would say this
DAW  perfectly fits the nerdy part of me, and fully satisfies my willingness to invest into the tools of my choice.

Recently, the 7th version of Reaper came out. Not exactly a groundbreaking update, if you ask me, and I'd not have even noticed any major  changes at first. As a software guy, I dread upgrades, and initially I didn't feel that it was worth it. In this case, however, I took the time to actually read the [release notes](https://dlz.reaper.fm/userguide/WhatsNewReaper7Summary_r2.pdf) highligting the changes.

What I found was a couple of features I personally found really great, one purely visual and the other more on the routing side:

## Greatest feature of Reaper 7 #1: Track delimiters

You can add non-collapsible "spacer" between tracks.

## Greatest feature of Reaper 7 #2: "Container" plugins + parallel processing

If you ever found the concept of subchains is approached in Ableton and missed that part in Reaper, there is really good news for you.

Previously fully sequential, with Reaper 7 you can have parallel processing with subchains within one track. The appearence of it is not exactly great, but it does the thing.
