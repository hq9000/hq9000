title: AI-generated book for learners of German (B1 vocabulary trainer)
---

Today I've finished a work I have been sporadically doing for the last couple of months.

It's a massive 512 pages book, downloadable as pdf, composed of 95 "stories" highlighting parts of the german vocabulary corresponding to B1 level. Use chatGPT for that, and it was fun, though annoying at times, when it was randomly changing its responses to very similar promtps.

One possible way to work with this book is to study 1-2 "stories" a day. The stories come with tables highlighting the necessary words with translations into english and russian.

Feel free to download this [german b1 vocabulary trainer](https://github.com/hq9000/b1-deutsch-storybook/releases/latest/download/b1-deutsch-ai-storybook-eng-rus.pdf).
