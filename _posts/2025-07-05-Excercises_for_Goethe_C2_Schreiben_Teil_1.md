title: "5 Exercises for preparation for C2 Exam at Goethe Institut (Schreiben Teil 1)"
---

I want to publish something I've used for my preparation for C2 Exam at Goethe Institut (German language). This PDF contains 5 exercises that resemble the first task in writing test of Goethe Institut C2 exam (Grosses Deutsches Sprachdiplom), namely the one that asks you to rewrite sentences. I found surprisingly few examples in the Internet for my preparations so I decided to make some myself.  These exercises are made with Gemini AI with a few manual fixes.

[Download PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hq9000/goethe_c2_schreiben_teil1_uebungen/refs/heads/master/goethe_c2_schreiben_teil1_uebung.pdf)

Each page of this document contains a small text, words to use for replacement, and a possible answer for self-check.
Feel free to use them for your preparations and good luck at your exam!
