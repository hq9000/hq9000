title: "UnknownMusic.cc was launched: A random feed of all new Spotify releases"

Recently, I had a bit of spare time and thus was able to complete something that was on my mind for quite a while.
It is a website, where you can [discover new releases of lesser known artists of recent years](https://unknownmusic.cc).

As a regular Spotify user, I was always a bit frustrated by the lack of the way off seeing "what's new". Yeah, they have "new releases" section, but it shows either something similar to what I have seen before, or some popular stuff. What I do sometimes want to have is just a raw stream of stuff being released, including the one from producers like me.

I remember the time when Yandex Music had something similar, but now it's gone. Spotify seems to be not willing to provide this raw feed either. But why? I guess it goes against their goals of having an "average listener" spending as much time on the platform as possible. Sadly, it means that a lot of lesser known producers hardly get a chance to get heard.

So, this new service, which I named, hopefully aptly enough, "[Unknown Music](https://unknownmusic.cc)", through the use of Spotify API, maintains a small (a few thousand) selection of albums and randomly presents 8 of them to the user. It is by no means a complete feed, but, rather, a hopefully representative sample of new stuff.

Is it actually useful? Well, for me it is, I have already enriched my playlist with quite a few gems that I would have never discovered otherwise. Thus let me invite you to have a look as well!
