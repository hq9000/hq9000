title: MIDI copy to channels, a Reaper plugin useful for synth layering
---

I have recently created a small jesusonic plugin called "MIDI copy to channels" to facilitate sound layering with multitimbral synths.

Basically, it allows you, with one midi source, make several sounds played. In my case, I find it rather useful with synths like TTS-1 and Roland Sound Canvas.

More on that in the video below.
