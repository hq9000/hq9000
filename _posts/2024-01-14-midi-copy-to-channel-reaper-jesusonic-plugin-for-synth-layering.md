title: MIDI copy to channels, a Reaper plugin useful for synth layering
---

I have recently created a small jesusonic plugin called "MIDI copy to channels" to facilitate sound layering with multitimbral synths.

Basically, it allows you, with one midi source, make several sounds played. In my case, I find it rather useful with synths like TTS-1 and Roland Sound Canvas.

Feel free to get the plugin here: [https://github.com/hq9000/reaper_tools/blob/master/js/midi_copy_to_channels.js](https://github.com/hq9000/reaper_tools/blob/master/js/midi_copy_to_channels.js)
