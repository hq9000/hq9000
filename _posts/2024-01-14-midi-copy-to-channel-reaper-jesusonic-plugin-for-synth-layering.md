title: "MIDI copy to channels", a Reaper plugin useful for synth layering
---

I have recently created a small jesusonic plugin to facilitate sound layering with multitimbral synths. More on that in the video below.

Basically, it allows you, with one midi source, make several sounds played. In my case, I find it rather useful with synths like TTS-1 and Roland Sound Canvas.
