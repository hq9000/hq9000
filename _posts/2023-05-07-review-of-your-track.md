title: Review of your tracks by a producer, free of charge
---

I know it very well how hard it becomes to maintain an objective view of your production after weeks spent working on it. You can hardly trust your ears simply because they are so tired and you are too emotionally attached to your product.

How to deal with that? Perhaps you have a collaborator that can help you with that. Another good idea is to frequently check how your product sounds against the chosen reference.

Or, perhaps, you want me to review your track?

That is - comment on the sounds, the balance, the space, and the overall structure of it? It's always nice to have another pair of ears and another opinion, right?

Drop me a line to `grechin.sergey(at)gmail.com`! I'd enjoy doing that (and it wont cost you a thing)!

As a fellow producer, I guarantee that it contains nothing but precise and actionable advice :)

See you later!

Sergey
