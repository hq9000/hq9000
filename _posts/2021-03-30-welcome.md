# Welcome to my blog

Over the time, I noticed myself more than once having "this could be cool to write in a blog about" moments from time to time, except... I didn't have a blog.

So to fix that omission, with the help of github pages, I start my own blog for different, mostly tech-related, notes, memos and things like that.

I specifically chose [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) with static site generator ([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) for this thing to be able to last for years without much attendance.

These two appear to be, though not completely effortless, a quite viable thing. Essentially, I can edit and add posts right in my IDE and publish them by pushing into the specially configured github repo.

Well, for now, that's it. The blog is running, the domain is configured, and now it's going to be some waiting for the next "blogging" moment to arrive.

Until then, stay tuned!
